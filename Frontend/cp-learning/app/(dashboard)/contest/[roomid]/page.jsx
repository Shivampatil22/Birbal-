      "Polycarpus has a ribbon, its length is n. He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions: After the cutting each ribbon piece should have length a, b or c. After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum. Help Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.",
